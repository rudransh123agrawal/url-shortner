# Url Shortner

Project URL: https://urlshortner-django.herokuapp.com/

URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web that enables the Uniform Resource Locator to be made considerably shorter and still direct to the desired page. This is done by using a redirect path to a web page that has a long URL.

The project is developed using Django for backend and HTML and CSS for frontend. 

## Usage
When the user enters the link, a short link will appear. Use clipboard emote to copy the link. The link will redirect you to the original link. 

It has been deployed on Heroku. If you want then you can buy a domain and connect it with the Heroku as well. This will shortner the link even more.
